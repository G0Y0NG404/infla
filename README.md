>>>>>>>>>>..Write a program to gauge the amount of 
inflation over the past year. The program asks
for the price of an item (such as a hotdog or a 
one-carat diamond) both one year ago and 
today. It estimates the inflation rate as the 
difference in price divided by last yearâ€™s price. 
Also print out the estimated price of the item in 
one and in two years from the time of the 
calculation. The increase in cost in one year is 
estimated as the inflation rate times the price.<<<<<<<<<<<,
